Have you ever wanted to rickyroll your boss but found out that links
like [goo.gl/ejKmN3][rickyroll goo.gl],
[bit.ly/LEcVV7][rickyroll bit.ly] and (*ekhm*)
[youtu.be/I6OXjnBIW-4][rickyroll youtu.be] were way too obvious? Well,
I did. A couple of times actually, but he obviously knew what was coming
when he saw those coming from me.

So I made this. And now you can trick your boss too. Your welcome.

Please contact me if you found a redirect that was malicious. I realize
that this can possibly be used in such way - it's the opposite of my 
intentions, and I try to prevent that in a couple of ways but
(unfortunately) nothing is perfect.

Feel free to use, ask, fork, star, report bugs, fix them,
suggest enhancements and point out any mistakes.
